## build-docker-images.groovy
Builds local images based on https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/ with tools gcc, cmake, maven, sbt. Add user jenkins to avoid "I have no name!" in running with docker-workflow-plugin containers.  
List of images:  
 - ubuntu14cuda75 - FROM nvidia/cuda:7.6-cudnn5-devel-ubuntu14.04  
 - ubuntu14cuda80 - FROM nvidia/cuda:8.0-cudnn5-devel-ubuntu14.04  
 - centos6cuda7 - FROM nvidia/cuda:7.5-cudnn5-devel-centos6  
 - centos6cuda80 - FROM nvidia/cuda:8.0-cudnn5-devel-centos6  

In future it could be updated with automatic push to skymind docker registry.
